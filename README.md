## Data Challenge
To provide probabilistic predictions of temperature on the high-fidelity domain (Panel b) from low-fidelity wind and temperature data (Panel a). Elevation data for the high-fidelity domain is also avaiable 

## Data

You can find the data [here](https://github.com/scotthosking/mf_modelling/tree/main/data)

Other potentially useful datasets
* [Climate Data Guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data) - Large-scale climate phenomena and oscillations that may relate to local climate variability, e.g., [Nino 3.4](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/nino-sst-indices-nino-12-3-34-4-oni-and-tni)
* [Weather stations](https://github.com/scotthosking/get-station-data) - local point-based measurements which provide a highly localised timeseries of the atmospheric conditions.
